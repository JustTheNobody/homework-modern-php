Aims and themes of the network
The Life History and Biography network is a lively forum – “a community of learners, researchers, 
and citizens” (Formenti, West, 2016, p. 11) for debate on research using narrative, biographical 
and auto/biographical methods so as to illuminate adult lives and learning from the insider’s perspective, 
as well as to locate such lives in a psychosocial and cultural context. Our conferences – held every year,
 in the first week of March, Thursday to Sunday, since 1993 – attract significant numbers of researchers, 
including doctoral students and senior researchers, from a wide range of different disciplinary backgrounds.
 Participants come from every corner of Europe, and beyond (e.g. Australia, Brazil, Canada, South Africa, South Korea, and the United States).

Within adult education and lifelong learning, life history and biographical approaches vary considerably, and the network represents a variety 
of epistemological, theoretical and methodological frames. Our conferences are based on recognition and celebration of this diversity, 
since it brings us to a deeper and richer relationship to research and its possibilities. Hence we have worked over time to build a 
dynamic community, and create spaces for dialogue, demonstration, reflexivity and discovery enabling participants to write and publish 
together, to devise new research projects and collaborate in other ways. Earlier conferences explored methodology and different approaches, 
spanning the theoretical and practical, political, social, spiritual, and aesthetic issues.

spanning the theoretical and practical, political, social, spiritual, and aesthetic issues.

Aims and themes of the network
The Life History and Biography network is a lively forum – “a community of learners, researchers, 
and citizens” (Formenti, West, 2016, p. 11) for debate on research using narrative, biographical 
and auto/biographical methods so as to illuminate adult lives and learning from the insider’s perspective, 
as well as to locate such lives in a psychosocial and cultural context. Our conferences – held every year,
 in the first week of March, Thursday to Sunday, since 1993 – attract significant numbers of researchers, 
including doctoral students and senior researchers, from a wide range of different disciplinary backgrounds.
 Participants come from every corner of Europe, and beyond (e.g. Australia, Brazil, Canada, South Africa, South Korea, and the United States).

Within adult education and lifelong learning, life history and biographical approaches vary considerably, and the network represents a variety 
of epistemological, theoretical and methodological frames. Our conferences are based on recognition and celebration of this diversity, 
since it brings us to a deeper and richer relationship to research and its possibilities. Hence we have worked over time to build a 
dynamic community, and create spaces for dialogue, demonstration, reflexivity and discovery enabling participants to write and publish 
together, to devise new research projects and collaborate in other ways. Earlier conferences explored methodology and different approaches, 
spanning the theoretical and practical, political, social, spiritual, and aesthetic issues.
